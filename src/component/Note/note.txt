useState -> 

What is useState() in React ? The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. React has two types of components, one is class components which are ES6 classes that extend from React and the other is functional components.

We can also pass a function as an argument if the initial state has to be computed. And the value returned by the function will be used as the initial state.

useEffect -> 

useEffect is short for ‘use side effect’. Effects are when our application reacts with the outside world, like working with an API. It allows us to run a function based on whether something changed. useEffect also allows us to combine componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

axios ->

What is Axios? (A little bit of history) Axios is used to communicate with the backend and it also supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It is a library which is used to make requests to an API, return data from the API, and then do things with that data in our React application

npm install axios

api ->

context -> 

The React context provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the components tree. The context is used to manage global data, e.g. global state, theme, services, user settings, and more.

context provides a way to pass data through the components tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

useReducer -> 

One of the most popular Hooks among developers so far is useReducer, which allows us to handle some complex state manipulations and updates,

useReducer is a Hook that is used fro managemant 
it is an alernative to useState
What's Defference between -> useState && useReducer
useState is build using useReducer

useState -> State
useEffect -> SideEffect
useContext -> Context api
useReducer -> Reducer


java script reduce vs react useReducer

reduce ->

arr.reducer(reducer, initialValue)
singleValue = reduce(accumulator, itemValue)
reduce methods return a signle value

useReducer ->

useReducer(reduce, initialState)
newState = reduce(currentState, action)
useReducer returns a pair of values [newState, dispatch]
